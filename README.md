## Getting Started.
Hola Andy, welcome to your programming journey. In these instructions - we're going to go over the pre-work to get you setup. This is the boring stuff needed at the start, so you can really hit the ground running, with some good programming hygiene.

Keep in mind - alot of this is python specific - as each language is quite different when it comes to compiling code. I'll call out what is python specific.

The first steps are:
- Setting up Git.
- Downloading Python
- Downloading Packages to Python

## Setting up Git (Not Python Specific)

### Overview
Git is a version control software that is applicable to just about all coding. It's critical so you can track + save changes to your code, rollback changes as needed, and collaborate with others (this makes it so we can both be working on the same files at the same time, without overwriting each other).

### Downloads
To get started - go ahead and download Git (and git bash) from the link [here](https://git-scm.com/). After this - you should have GitBash installed on your computer.

Next step is setting up a GitHub account. This is so your code is hosted in the cloud + you can collaborate on code together. Make an account at the site [here] (https://github.com/).
